## About Me

I am a product-focused full-stack engineer and startup founder based in Ghana.  
I build scalable SaaS products from concept to deployment, combining technical execution with product strategy.

I am the founder of **Sullve**, a venture studio focused on building and operating globally competitive digital products. Under Sullve, I lead the architecture, engineering systems, and technical direction of the products we develop.

My approach is execution-first: build before raising, validate before scaling, and design systems that are structurally sound from day one.
